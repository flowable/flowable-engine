## General Flowable REST principles

### Installation and Authentication

Flowable includes a REST API to the Flowable CMMN engine that can be installed by deploying the flowable-rest.war file to a servlet container like Apache Tomcat. However, it can also be used in another web-application by including the servlet (and/or its mappings) in your application and add all flowable-rest dependencies to the classpath.

By default Flowable REST will connect to an in-memory H2 database. You can change the database settings in the flowable-app.properties file in the *WEB-INF/META-INF/flowable-app* folder. The REST API uses JSON format (<http://www.json.org>) and is built upon the Spring MVC (<http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html>).

All REST-resources require a valid user with the *rest-access-api* privilege to be authenticated by default. If any valid user should be able to call the REST API, the *flowable.rest.app.authentication-mode* can be set to *any-user* (this was the default in older versions of Flowable).

A default user that can access the REST API can be configured by settings the following properties:

    flowable.rest.app.admin.user-id=rest-admin
    flowable.rest.app.admin.password=test
    flowable.rest.app.admin.first-name=Rest
    flowable.rest.app.admin.last-name=Admin

When the REST app boots up, the user is created if it doesn’t exist or fetched otherwise. This user will be given the *access-rest-api* privilege which is needed by default to access the REST API. **Do not forget to change the password of this user afterwards**. If the *flowable.rest.app.admin.user-id* is not set, no users or privileges will be created. So, after the initial setup, removing this property will not remove the user nor the privilege that has been configured before.

Basic HTTP access authentication is used, so you should always include a *Authorization: Basic …​==* HTTP-header when performing requests or include the username and password in the request-url (for example, *<http://username:password@localhost:8080/xyz>*).

**We recommend that you use Basic Authentication in combination with HTTPS.**

### Configuration

The Flowable REST web application uses the Spring Boot Flowable starter for starting the Flowable CMMN engine, defining the basic authentication security using Spring security, and to define the variable converters for specific variable handling.
A small number of properties can be defined by changing the flowable-app.properties file .


### Usage in Tomcat

Due to [default security properties on Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/security-howto.html), **escaped forward slashes (%2F and %5C) are not allowed by default (400-result is returned).** This may have an impact on the deployment resources and their data-URL, as the URL can potentially contain escaped forward slashes.

When issues are experienced with unexpected 400-results, set the following system-property:

*-Dorg.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW\_ENCODED\_SLASH=true*

It’s best practice to always set the **Accept** and **Content-Type** (in case of posting/putting JSON) headers to **application/json** on the HTTP requests described below.

<tr class="even">
<td><p>409 - Conflict</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>415 - Unsupported Media Type</p></td>

<td><p>500 - Internal server error</p></td>
<td><p>The operation failed. An unexpected exception occurred while executing the operation. The response-body contains details about the error.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The media-type of the HTTP-responses is always application/json unless binary content is requested (for example, deployment resource data), the media-type of the content is used.

### Error response body

When an error occurs (both client and server, 4XX and 5XX status-codes) the response body contains an object describing the error that occurred. An example for a 404-status when a task is not found:

    {
      "statusCode" : 404,
      "errorMessage" : "Could not find a task with id '444'."
    }

### Request parameters

#### URL fragments

Parameters that are part of the URL (for example, the deploymentId parameter in http://host/flowable-rest/form-api/form-repository/deployments/{deploymentId})
need to be properly escaped (see [URL-encoding or Percent-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding)) in case the segment contains special characters. Most frameworks have this functionality built in, but it should be taken into account. Especially for segments that can contain forward-slashes (for example, deployment resource), this is required.

#### Rest URL query parameters

Parameters added as query-string in the URL (for example, the name parameter used in http://host/flowable-rest/form-api/form-repository/deployments?name=Deployment) can have the following types and are mentioned in the corresponding REST-API documentation:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Type</th>
<th>Format</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>String</p></td>
<td><p>Plain text parameters. Can contain any valid characters that are allowed in URLs. In the case of a XXXLike parameter, the string should contain the wildcard character % (properly URL-encoded). This allows you to specify the intent of the like-search. For example, 'Tas%' matches all values, starting with 'Tas'.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Integer</p></td>
<td><p>Parameter representing an integer value. Can only contain numeric non-decimal values, between -2.147.483.648 and 2.147.483.647.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Long</p></td>
<td><p>Parameter representing a long value. Can only contain numeric non-decimal values, between -9.223.372.036.854.775.808 and 9.223.372.036.854.775.807.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Boolean</p></td>
<td><p>Parameter representing a boolean value. Can be either true or false. All other values other than these will cause a '405 - Bad request' response.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Date</p></td>
<td><p>Parameter representing a date value. Use the ISO-8601 date-format (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO-8601 on wikipedia</a>) using both time and date-components (e.g. 2013-04-03T23:45Z).</p></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Paging and sorting

Paging and order parameters can be added as query-string in the URL (for example, the name parameter used in http://host/flowable-rest/form-api/form-repository/deployments?sort=name).

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td><p>Name of the sort key, for which the default value and the allowed values are different per query implementation.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>order</p></td>
<td><p>asc</p></td>
<td><p>Sorting order which can be 'asc' or 'desc'.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>start</p></td>
<td><p>0</p></td>
<td><p>Parameter to allow for paging of the result. By default the result will start at 0.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>size</p></td>
<td><p>10</p></td>
<td><p>Parameter to allow for paging of the result. By default the size will be 10.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

> **Note**
>
> Bear in mind that the start parameter is used as the offset of the query. For example, to get tasks in three pages of three items each (9 items), we would use:
>
>     GET /runtime/tasks?start=0&size=3
>     GET /runtime/tasks?start=3&size=3
>     GET /runtime/tasks?start=6&size=3

#### JSON query variable format

    {
      "name" : "variableName",
      "value" : "variableValue",
      "operation" : "equals",
      "type" : "string"
    }

<table>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>name</p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Name of the variable to include in a query. Can be empty in the case where 'equals' is used in some queries to query for resources that have <strong>any variable name</strong> with the given value.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>value</p></td>
<td><p>Yes</p></td>
<td><p>Value of the variable included in the query, should include a correct format for the given type.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>operator</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>type</p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Type of variable to use. When omitted, the type will be deduced from the value parameter. Any JSON text-values will be considered of type string, JSON booleans of type boolean, JSON numbers of type long or integer depending on the size of the number. We recommended you include an explicit type when in doubt. Types supported out of the box are listed below.</p></td>

#### Variable representation

When working with variables (execute decision), the REST API uses some common principles and JSON-format for both reading and writing. The JSON representation of a variable looks like this:

    {
      "name" : "variableName",
      "value" : "variableValue",
      "valueUrl" : "http://...",
      "type" : "string"
    }

<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td><p>Yes</p></td>
<td><p>Name of the variable.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>value</p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Value of the variable. When writing a variable and value is omitted, null will be used as value.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>valueUrl</p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>When reading a variable of type binary or serializable, this attribute will point to the URL from where the raw binary data can be fetched.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>type</p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Type of the variable. See table below for additional information on types. When writing a variable and this value is omitted, the type will be deduced from the raw JSON-attribute request type and is limited to either string, double, integer and boolean. We advise you to always include a type to make sure no wrong assumption about the type are made.</p></td>

It’s possible to support additional variable-types with a custom JSON representation (either simple value or complex/nested JSON object). By extending the initializeVariableConverters() method on org.flowable.cmmn.rest.service.api.CmmnRestResponseFactory, you can add additional org.flowable.rest.variable.RestVariableConverter classes to support converting your POJOs to a format suitable for transferring through REST and converting the REST-value back to your POJO. The actual transformation to JSON is done by Jackson.

### Query for historic variable instances

    POST query/historic-variable-instances

*Request body:*

```
{
  "caseDefinitionId" : "59fd213c-3c6b-11ea-8548-38c986587585",
  ...

  "variables" : [
    {
      "name" : "myVariable",
      "value" : 1234,
      "operation" : "equals",
      "type" : "long"
    }
  ]
}
```


All supported JSON parameter fields allowed are exactly the same as the parameters found in the previous section, but passed in as JSON-body arguments rather than URL-parameters to allow for more advanced querying and preventing errors with request-uri's that are too long. On top of that, the query allows for filtering based on case variables. The +variables+ property is a JSON-array containing objects with the regular Flowable variables format.

|Response code|Description|
|-|-|
|200|Indicates request was successful and the tasks are returned.|
|400|Indicates an parameter was passed in the wrong format. The status-message contains additional information.|

## Job management

The CMMN REST API allows full access to manage async jobs, timer jobs, suspended jobs and deadletter jobs.
The API is exactly the same as the one [for the BPMN engine](../bpmn/ch15-REST#jobs), except `management` is replaced with `cmmn-management`.
