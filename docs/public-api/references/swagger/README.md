## Important Notice

**Please don't copy & paste automatically generated OpenApi Specification files inside this folder.**

### Explanation

OpenApi Specifications files for Flowable REST API are mostly generated automatically [by Swagger/OAS annotation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X) from inside the code.

Sadly due to Swagger V2 design and Flowable REST API design some usages/use cases are not well supported.

It implies the OAS files automatically generated ([by Flowable OAS Generator project for example](../../tools/flowable-oas-generator)) contains some issues which must be fixed manually. 

OAS Files contained here in this folder represents the stable documentation version of the APIs and can be used by external tools.

Restrictions due to design considerations are marked inside the documentation.

#### For Information

In source code OAS issues are generally marked with **FIXME OASv3**
