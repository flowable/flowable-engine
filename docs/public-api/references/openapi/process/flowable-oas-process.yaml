    # flowable / flow??b(??)l /


    - a compact and highly efficient workflow and Business Process Management
    (BPM) platform for developers, system admins and business users.

    - a lightning fast, tried and tested BPMN 2 process engine written in Java.
    It is Apache 2.0 licensed open source, with a committed community.

    - can run embedded in a Java application, or as a service on a server, a
    cluster, and in the cloud. It integrates perfectly with Spring. With a rich
    Java and REST API, it is the ideal engine for orchestrating human or system
    activities.

      summary: Query for tasks
      description: >-
        All supported JSON parameter fields allowed are exactly the same as the
        parameters found for getting a collection of tasks (except for
        candidateGroupIn which is only available in this POST task query REST
        service), but passed in as JSON-body arguments rather than
        URL-parameters to allow for more advanced querying and preventing errors
        with request-uri?s that are too long. On top of that, the query allows
        for filtering based on task and process variables. The taskVariables and
        processInstanceVariables are both JSON-arrays containing objects with
        the format as described here.

        This endpoint can be used in 2 ways: By passing a JSON Body
        (RestVariable) or by passing a multipart/form-data Object.

        It's possible to update simple (non-binary) variable or  binary
        variable

        Any number of variables can be passed into the request body array.
