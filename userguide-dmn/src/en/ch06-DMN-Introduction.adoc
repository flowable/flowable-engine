== DMN 1.1 Introduction

[[whatIsDmn]]


=== What is DMN?

Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard published by the link:$$http://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.1$$[Object Management Group]. It is a standard approach for describing and modeling repeatable decisions within organizations to ensure that decision models are interchangeable across organizations.

=== What is a DMN definition

The root element of the DMN 1.1 schema is a *definitions* element. Within this element multiple decision definitions can be defined (although we advise to
have only one process definition in each file, since this simplifies maintenance later in the development process). Within each decision one expression can be defined. There are several types of expressions. Within Flowable, currently, the expression type *decision table* is supported.

=== Defining a DMN definition

It's possible to create a DMN Definition with a plain text editor. But for this example we'll start by using the decision table editor included in the Flowable modeler.

We'll implement a very simple use case; determine the discount percentage based on a customer category.

Start by opening the decision tables section within the Flowable modeler.

And select *Create Decision Table*.

image::images/decision_tables_2.png[align="center"]

Provide a decision table name and a unique decision table key and select *Create new decision table*.

You're now ready to define your decision table. Let's describe what is presented within the editor.

==== Hit Policy

In the top left corner you can select a *hit policy*.

There are 2 hit policies available; *first (single pass)* and *any (single pass)*.
When hit policy first is selected the execution of the decision table will stop when a rule is valid.
When hit policy any is selected all valid rules will executed.

==== Input and Output expressions

The header of the decision table itself is divided in two sections; blue and green. The blue section are the *input expressions*. The green the *output expressions*.

Within an input expression you can define the variable that will be used in the expression of the rule input entries (explained below). It's possible to define multiple input expressions by selecting *Add Input*.

image::images/decision_tables_5.png[align="center"]

Within an output expression you can define what variable will be created to form the result of a decision table execution. (The value of the variable will be determined by the output entry expression; explained below). It's possible to define multiple output expressions by selecting *Add Output*.

==== Rules

Each rule consists of one or more input entries and one or more output entries.
A input entry is an expression that will be evaluated against the input variable (of that 'column'). When all input entries are evaluated true the rule is considered true an the output entry is evaluated.

[NOTE]
====
The DMN spec provides a specification for an expression language; (S)-FEEL. Currently we do not supported this part of the spec. Within Flowable DMN we use link:$$https://github.com/mvel/mvel$$[ MVEL] as the expression language.

To enter an expression double click on the corresponding cell. 
In this example the expression _== "BRONZE"_ is entered. Combined the variable defined in the corresponding input expression (column header) this will result during runtime in the full expression _customerCat == "BRONZE"_.

image::images/decision_tables_7.png[align="center"]

To enter an output expression double click the corresponding cell.
In this example the expression _5_ is entered. This is actually more like an implicit assignment. The value 5 will be assigned to the variable in the corresponding output entry (column) when all input entries of that rule are evaluated true.

We can then continue completing the decision table by adding more rules (by selecting Add Rule).

image::images/decision_tables_8.png[align="center"]

In our example rule 4 has an empty input entry. Empty input entries will be evaluated by the engine as true. This means that if none of the other rules are valid the outcome of rule 4 will be the output of this decision table. In that case variable *discountPerc* will have value *0*.

The decision table can then be saved. Provide a unique Decision Table key.

=== Use in BPMN2.0 process

The newly created decision table can be used in a BPMN2.0 process by including a *Decision task* and selecting the *Decision table reference*.

image::images/decision_tables_10.png[align="center"]

In the process above the process has a start form that will provide the *customer category* to the process instance (and thus to the decision table).
The *Display Discount* user task displays the result of the decision table with an expression form field. Using the expression; ${discountperc}.

* Important to note here is that the decision table key used in Flowable is the decision id in the DMN XML. *
