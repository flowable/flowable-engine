    Public API of the Flowable engine.<br><br>
    Typical usage of the API starts by the creation of a {@link org.flowable.engine.ProcessEngineConfiguration}
    (typically based on a configuration file), from which a {@link org.flowable.engine.ProcessEngine} can be obtained.<br><br>
    Through the services obtained from such a {@link org.flowable.engine.ProcessEngine}, BPM and workflow operation
    can be executed:<br><br>
    
    <b>{@link org.flowable.engine.RepositoryService}: </b> Manages {@link org.flowable.engine.repository.Deployment}s.<br>

    <b>{@link org.flowable.engine.RuntimeService}: </b> For starting and searching {@link org.flowable.engine.runtime.ProcessInstance}s.<br>
    
    <b>{@link org.flowable.engine.TaskService}: </b> Exposes operations to manage human (standalone) tasks, such as claiming, completing and assigning tasks.<br>

    <b>{@link org.flowable.engine.IdentityService}: </b> Used for managing users, groups and the relations between them.<br>
        
    <b>{@link org.flowable.engine.ManagementService}: </b> Exposes engine administration and maintenance operations,
    which have no relation to the runtime exection of business processes.<br>
    
    <b>{@link org.flowable.engine.HistoryService}: </b> Exposes information about ongoing and past process instances.<br>
    
    <b>{@link org.flowable.engine.FormService}: </b> Access to form data and rendered forms for starting new process instances and completing tasks.<br>
