<h1>Flowable Release Notes</h1>

<h3>Release Notes - Flowable - 6.4.0</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Upgrade to Spring 5.x for all the integration modules using Spring.</li>
    <li>Upgrade Java Persistence API to 2.1</li>
    <li>Upgrade JMS API to 2.0.1</li>
    <li>Support for using java.time.Duration variables and expressions for Timer durations</li>
</ul>

<h4>Upgrade notes</h4>

<h5>Idm Engine SpringEncoder</h5>
<p>
    The deprecated constructor from SpringEncoder that accepted <i>org.springframework.security.authentication.encoding.PasswordEncoder</i> has been removed
</p>

<h5>Custom IdGenerator using a Bean in Spring Boot</h5>
<p>
    It is now possible to define the custom IdGenerator for the Flowable Process engine, by creating a bean of type IdGenerator.
    If no bean is provided the StrongUuidGenerator will be used.
    If there is a bean qualified with @Process then this one would be used, otherwise a unique global one would be used.
    If there are more global beans then the default StrongUuidGenerator will be used.
</p>

<h5>FlowableFunctionDelegate changes</h5>
<p>
    The method <i>functionClass</i> has been removed from the <i>org.flowable.common.engine.api.delegate.FlowableFunctionDelegate</i> interface.
    This doesn't change anything with regards to adding custom functions to expressions: returning the right Method in <i>functionMethod()</i> is enough.
</p>

<h3>Release Notes - Flowable - 6.3.1</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Introduction of an app engine, so apps are now a first class citizen and the process engine is not misused any more to handle app deployments. 
    When starting the Flowable Task application all app deployments are automatically migrated to the new app engine.</li>
    <li>Added async history support to the CMMN engine.</li>
    <li>Added more history information to the CMMN engine with historic plan items.</li>
    <li>Improved the Spring Boot support and upgraded to Spring Boot 2.0.2.</li>
    <li>Enhanced debugger in the Flowable Task application to evaluate expressions and scripts.</li>
    <li>Made the job service more generic with the scope type property to improve the possibility to run different job handlers for different job types.</li>
    <li>Various small bugfixes all around.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Michael Lippens (mlippens)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Upgrade notes</h4>
	
<h5>Package renaming</h5>
	
<p>To make the Flowable modules compatible with OSGi and Java 9 modules some package renaming was needed to prevent clashes.
The renaming has been done according to this pattern org.flowable.engine.common -> org.flowable.common.engine</p>

<h5>StrongUuidGenerator usage with Spring Boot</h5>

<p>The Spring Boot process auto configuration now uses the StrongUuidGenerator. In case you were overwriting the default one you can remove that.
In case you want to keep using the DbIdGenerator, then just add the following bean to your configuration:
<pre><code>
    @Bean
    public EngineConfigurationConfigurer&lt;SpringProcessEngineConfiguration&gt; processEngineDbIdGeneratorConfigurer() {
        return engineConfiguration -> engineConfiguration.setIdGenerator(new DbIdGenerator());
    }
</code></pre>
The default values of the DbIdGenerator would be filled in during the creation of the Process Engine.

<h5>IdmEngineConfigurator</h5>

<p>
    The default <code>IdmEngineConfigurator</code> and <code>SpringIdmEngineConfigurator</code> have been moved from <code>org.flowable.app.engine.impl.cfg</code>
    and <code>org.flowable.spring.configurator</code> to <code>org.flowable.idm.engine.configurator</code> and <code>org.flowable.idm.spring.configurator</code>
    respectively. In case you have used them please replace your imports.
</p>

<h5>Async history classes package change</h5>
<p>
    The async history classes have been moved from the process engine module to the job service, to make them available for other components. Generally, the packages now have <code>job.service</code> added to make this clear.
    <ul>
      <li>
          Classes with regards to async history collection and execution (<code>AbstractAsyncHistoryJobHandler, AsyncHistoryJobHandler, AsyncHistoryListener, AsyncHistorySessionFactory, 
          AsyncHistorySession, DefaultAsyncHistoryJobProducer, HistoryJsonTransformer</code>) in the <code>org.flowable.engine.impl.history.async</code> have been moved to the <code>org.flowable.job.service.impl.history.async</code> package.</li>
      <li>
          Classes related to executing async jobs using a message queue (most notably <code>AsyncHistoryJobMessageHandler and AsyncHistoryJobMessageReceiver</code>) have been moved from the 
          <code>org.flowable.engine.impl.asyncexecutor.message</code> to the <code>org.flowable.job.service.impl.asyncexecutor.message</code> package.     
      </li>
      <li>
          Similarly, for executing async history jobs using a message queue: the classes in the package <code>org.flowable.engine.impl.history.async.message</code> are now found in the <code>org.flowable.job.service.impl.history.async.message</code> package.
      </li>
    </ul>  
    Updating the imports is sufficient when upgrading.
</p>

<h3>Release Notes - Flowable - 6.3.0</h3>

<p>Flowable 6.3.0 has turned out to be a big release with many new features (and even more fixes). Many thanks to all the community contributers that participated in the release
and a special shout-out to Pascal Schumacher, Zach Visagie, Robert Hafner, Christophe Deneux and Seif El Deen Khaled</p>

<h4>Highlights</h4>

<h4>Note: Flowable now requires JDK 8 as a minimum version!</h4>

<h4>GENERAL</h4>

<p>The Spring Boot starters have all been updated to version 2.0. There are now starters available for each engine (BPMN, CMMN and DMN). 
Check the completely revised documentation for more details!</p>

<ul>
    <li>Support and fixes for running various modules on JDK 9 (the engines themselves already ran on JDK 9)</li>
    <li>Updated all 3rd-party libraries to latest versions</li>
    <li>The REST app can now be configured to use privileges, instead of all users being able to make REST calls.</li>
</ul>

<h4>BPMN</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Performance enhancements with great results. Read all about it here: <a href="https://blog.flowable.org/2018/03/05/flowable-6-3-0-performance-benchmark/">https://blog.flowable.org/2018/03/05/flowable-6-3-0-performance-benchmark/</a></li>
    <li>Dynamic task and subprocess injection into running process instances is now fully supported and out of experimental state</li>
    <li>Allow the configuration of history on individual process definitions, overriding the engine default setting</li>
    <li>Introduce the 'triggerable' service task: a service task that provides configurable service calls that are executed externally and call the engine when done. 
    The implementation is guaranteed to be correct with regards to the transactional behavior of the engine.</li>
    <li>Support for a transaction-lifecycle based event listener</li>
    <li>Support for 'sameDeployment' when looking up the called process definition for a call activity</li>
    <li>HTTP task: support for storing response variables transiently</li>
    <li>Multi instance: support for Iterable when resolving a collection (e.g. ArrayNode)</li>
</ul>

<h4>CMMN</h4>

<ul>
    <li>REST API support for all CMMN services and operations</li>
    <li>Support for asynchronous service tasks</li>
    <li>Support for manual activation rules and enabling/manually starting plan items through the runtime service</li>
    <li>Support for required rule</li>
    <li>Support for autocomplete</li>
    <li>Support for completion neutral</li>
    <li>A Script task type has been added</li>
    <li>Support for User event listeners</li>
    <li>Support for viewing and managing CMMN date in the Admin app</li>
</ul>

<h4>DMN</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Support for collection expressions, such as IN and NOT IN</li>
    <li>Improved decision table editor user experience to make it easier to add JUEL expressions in specific rules</li>
    <li>Support for viewing and managing decision executions in the Admin app</li>
</ul>

<h4>APPS</h4>

<ul>
    <li>All apps have been rewritten to use Spring Boot 2.0. All apps now use one property file for configuration. 
    Please check the documentation, as many new configuration options are available (with backwards compatibility for old properties).</li>
    <li>Support for expressions in the options fields, including dropdown, radio and hyperlink fields</li>
    <li>Support for a password fields in the form editor and runtime</li>
    <li>Multi-tenancy support in the Modeler by defining the active tenant in the Modeler property file</li>
</ul>

<h4>Upgrade notes</h4>

<p>
To remove duplicate code, some more logic has been added to the common modules, such as flowable-engine-common and flowable-common-rest. 
For example, the scripting engine has been moved to the flowable-engine-common module so it can be used by both the BPMN and the CMMN engine.
If you are using Flowable internal classes then it is possible that some package changes to the common modules are required.
Most of this should be automatically handled by your IDE.
</p>

<p>
All Flowable apps (IDM, Modeler, Task, Admin and REST) now read their configuration from the <i>flowable-app.properties</i> file, which is included in each WAR file in the <i>META-INF/flowable-app</i> folder.
Consequently, a single, shared <i>flowable-app.properties</i> can be placed on the classpath for all apps.
All property files (e.g. <i>db.properties</i> for the REST app) are still read and work in a backwards-compatible way.  
</p>

<p>
The default way user credentials are authenticated and verified when calling the Flowable REST API has changed. A user now needs to have the <i>access-rest-api</i> privilege (before, any valid credentials could be used).
An admin user can be given this privilege by setting the <i>flowable.rest.app.admin.user-id</i> and <i>flowable.rest.app.admin.password</i> properties in the <i>flowable-app.properties</i> file. On start-up, the admin user will be created if it doesn't exist, or it will be given the <i>access-rest-api</i> privilege. This admin user can then give other users this privilige using the Flowable IDM app or through a REST call (doing an HTTP post to <i>privileges/{privilegeId}/users</i> with the userId in the body).
</p>

<p>
By default, all Flowable apps (IDM, Modeler, Task, Admin and REST) are configured to use an in-memory H2 database that is persisted in the user home folder, which is shared between all apps by default. Previously, each app had its own in-memory H2 database.
</p>

<p>
Due to upgrading to the latest Spring Security dependencies for handling the authentication for all the Flowable apps, users can get a "cookie theft exception" when accessing the apps with a cookie from a previous version that is still present in the browser.
The reason for this is that Spring Security has changed the way cookie tokens are hashed. A hard refresh or relogin fixes this by generating a new cookie.
If you don't want to force your users to do this, you can delete all rows from the <i>ACT_ID_TOKEN</i> database table. This will invalidate all old cookies and all users will have to login again.
</p>

<h3>Release Notes - Flowable - 6.2.1</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Lots of additions to the CMMN 1.1 Engine, including timer support, repetition support, DMN and HTTP task support and variable query support.</li>
    <li>Rest documentation is now also generated based on the Swagger definitions to ensure it's always in sync with the REST controller code</li>
    <li>Improved support of ChangeActivityStateBuilder to move an execution in a process instance to another activity that's part of the process definition</li>
    <li>Enhanced the CMMN Modeler palette with timer event listeners, DMN and HTTP tasks and additional properties like timer expressions and repetition expressions.</li>
    <li>Improved support of CMMN in the Flowable Task app.</li>
    <li>Various small bugfixes all around.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Christophe Deneux (cdeneux)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Upgrade notes</h4>

<p>To harmonize the deployers between the BPMN and CMMN engine the ProcessEngineConfigurator interface has been renamed to EngineConfigurator and moved to the flowable-engine-common module.
In addition a new flowable-spring-common module has been added to shared common Spring classes between the BPMN and CMMN spring modules.</p>

<h3>Release Notes - Flowable - 6.2.0</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Introduction of a new CMMN 1.1 Engine. This provides an implementation of the <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CMMN/1.1/">CMMN 1.1 OMG standard</a>. A lot of effort has been put in this
    new Engine, and it uses a new set of database tables optimized for CMMN execution. We've added a new CMMN user guide to help you getting started. Note that since this is a first release, the
    CMMN Engine is marked as an experimental feature and missing features like timers and HTTP and Decision tasks will be added in next releases.</li>
    <li>Added a CMMN editor to the Flowable Modeler app.</li>
    <li>Added support for CMMN cases ot the Flowable Task app.</li>
    <li>The BPMN and CMMN engine share a number of common services like Tasks, Variables, Identity links and Jobs. Therefore these services are extracted from the core BPMN engine module and
    new modules have been created for each one of these services. The BPMN and CMMN engines make use of these services to provide for example Task and Variable support. With this approach Flowable is very
    flexible in the deployment model. You can run only the BPMN Engine, only the CMMN Engine or run them both together without any issues.</li>
    <li>Various small bugfixes all around.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Lori Small (lsmall)</li>
    <li>Michael Lippens (mlippens)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Upgrade notes</h4>

<p>Because of the extraction of the Task, Variable, Identity Link and Job services, we had to change the package names of the classes used in these modules.
This means that for example TaskQuery and Job Query have been moved to a new package. This was done to adhere to OSGi standards and to be ready for the new Java 9 version.
This however does mean that you run into some compilation issues while migration to version 6.2.0. We always try to prevent this as much as we can, but due to the new modules this wasn't possible in this release.
The common naming pattern of these new service is org.flowable.{servicename}.api for the API module and org.flowable.{servicename}.service for the service implementation module.
So org.flowable.task.api and org.flowable.task.service for example.</p>

<h3>Release Notes - Flowable - 6.1.2</h3>

<h4>Bug fix release</h4>

<p>Thanks to whee we found out that there's an issue with the release 6.1.1 when running it without an Internet connection <a href="https://forum.flowable.org/t/upgrading-6-1-0-to-6-1-1-could-not-read-idm-mybatis-configuration-file/753">https://forum.flowable.org/t/upgrading-6-1-0-to-6-1-1-could-not-read-idm-mybatis-configuration-file/753</a>.
This was fixed with the following commit <a href="https://github.com/flowable/flowable-engine/commit/7338015dc8aadc984ff9dd4ad3385b6a7b4ace6f">https://github.com/flowable/flowable-engine/commit/7338015dc8aadc984ff9dd4ad3385b6a7b4ace6f</a>.
Although an Internet connection is often available, we decided to do a bug fix release to prevent people from running into this issue.</p>

<h3>Release Notes - Flowable - 6.1.1</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Introduction of audit history in the DMN Engine. When history is enabled in the DMN Engine, an audit log of each decision execution is stored in the DMN database.
    By default the history is disabled.</li>
    <li>Replaced the MVEL expression language in the DMN Engine with the same JUEL expression language as used in the BPMN and Form Engine.</li>
    <li>Refactored DmnRuleService with new ExecuteDecisionBuilder and deprecated old execute decision methods.</li>
    <li>Call activity - allow to set output parameters a local variables for multi instance executions.</li>
    <li>Easier usage of async history in combination with a message queue (see <a href="https://github.com/flowable/flowable-examples/tree/master/async-history">https://github.com/flowable/flowable-examples/tree/master/async-history</a>)</li>
    <li>Performance improvement: introduce grouping and compression for async history data</li>
    <li>Various small bugfixes all around.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Upgrade notes</h4>

<p><b>CommandContext and related classes package changes:</b></p>

<p>
As a result of a refactoring that involved consolidating various classes and moving them to the <i>flowable-engine-common</i> module, following <i>internal</i> classes have changed packages.
</p>

<p>
The following applies to all engines (process, dmn, form, content and idm):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <i>CommandContext</i> class is now in the <i>org.flowable.engine.common.impl.interceptor</i> package.</li>
    <li>The various getter methods on the <i>CommandContext</i> that gave quick-access to various internal components are removed 
    (because the CommandContext is now shared between all engines). All engines now have a <i>CommandContextUtil</i> class that 
    should be used instead and which has said getter methods. The <i>org.flowable.engine.impl.context.Context</i> utlity class 
    in the process engine is still there for backwards compatibility and can be used as before, but simply delegates to the <i>CommandContextUtil</i> methods.</li>
    <li>The classes related to the command stack interceptors (<i>Command</i>, <i>CommandContextInterceptor</i>, <i>CommandExecutor</i>, <i>Log/Jta/RetryInterceptor</i>) are now in the <i>org.flowable.engine.common.impl.interceptor</i> package.</li>
    <li>The <i>DbSqlSession</i> and <i>DbSqlSessionFactory</i> classes are now found in the <i>org.flowable.engine.common.impl.db</i> package.</li>
    <li>Database schema management logic has moved from the <i>DbSqlSession</i> class to implementations of the <i>org.flowable.engine.common.impl.db.DbSchemaManager</i> interface.</li>
    <li>The <i>GenericManagerFactory</i> class is now in the <i>org.flowable.engine.common.impl.persistence</i> package.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The process engine now has the <i>org.flowable.engine.impl.util.EngineServiceUtil</i> utility class that can be used to get easily access to the configuration and services of the other engines.
</p>

<p><b>FlowableCancelledEvent.getCause() return value change</b></p>

<p>
The value that's passed in the <i>cause</i> of a <i>org.flowable.engine.delegate.event.FlowableCancelledEvent</i> has changed in the following cases:
<ul>
    <li>The event that is thrown for activities cancelled by a <i>message boundary event</i>.</li>
    <li>The event that is thrown for activities cancelled by a <i>signal boundary event</i>.</li>
    <li>The event that is thrown for activities cancelled by a <i>timer boundary event</i>.</li>
</ul>
Instead of passing an entity instance (MessageEventSubscriptionEntity, SignalEventSubscriptionEntity or JobEntity respectively) the BpmnModel
counterpart, as an instance of a subclass of <i>org.flowable.bpmn.model.FlowElement</i>, is passed instead which is consistent with the general value of the <i>cause</i> property.
Do note that due to the fact the return type of <i>getCause()</i> is <i>Object</i>, the compiler will not notice this, so best to look at the usage of the <i>FlowableCancelledEvent</i> in your code.
</p>

<h3>Release Notes - Flowable - 6.1.0</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Introduction of async history. By enabling the asyncHistoryEnabled property on the process engine configuration (default is false), 
    the history tables are not filled in the same transaction as the runtime tables. Instead an async history job is created and the history information will be written
    to the history tables in a separate, asynchronous transaction. This also opens up the option to not use the relational history tables at all, 
    and move the historic information to a NoSQL database directly. Pluggability points are available to implement the persistence logic to a NoSQL database.</li>
    <li>New REST task feature thanks to Harsha. With the new REST task it becomes trivial to do REST calls from a Flowable process instance. There's also support in the Flowable Modeler for REST tasks.</li>
    <li>Introduction of a new DMN decision table editor. To improve the usability of the DMN decision table editor we are now using the <a href="https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable">Handsontable</a> framework.</li>
    <li>The Engine SQL update logic has been improved to only update changed columns.</li>
    <li>The Odysseus JUEL code is now included directly in the flowable-engine-common module to prevent classloading issues due to conflicting JUEL libraries or even different versions of JUEL libraries.</li>
    <li>Added option to use a password encoder for the Flowable IDM engine (instead of the default plain text password persistence), thanks to Faizal!</li>
    <li>Support for static Groovy scripts compilation with the new flowable-groovy-script-static-engine module by using the groovy-static scriptFormat value, thanks to Filip (fgroch)!</li>
    <li>Several additions to the Form builder and renderer (min/max length, improved expression field and more).</li>
    <li>Various small bugfixes all around.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Release Notes - Flowable - 6.0.1</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>

<ul>
	<li>First bug fix release for Flowable 6!</li>
	<li>Improved LDAP support for the UI apps</li>
	<li>The i18n in the UI apps is now pluggable and there are some first additional languages included</li>
	<li>Improved event sub process support with nested event sub process support for non interrupting ones</li>
	<li>More hit policy support in the DMN Engine. The Decision Table editor will be updated in the Flowable 6.1.0 release. 
	The DMN Engine API has been refactored to take into account single and multiple output result objects.</li>
	<li>Various small bugfixes all around.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Release Notes - Flowable - 6.0.0</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>

<ul>
	<li>First official release of Flowable 6!</li>
	<li>Documentation has been updated to Flowable 6 and a DMN and Form Engine user guide have been added.</li>
	<li>Various small bugfixes all around.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Release Notes - Flowable - 6.0.0.RC1</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Package renaming to org.flowable, and renaming of config files to flowable.cfg.xml and flowable-context.xml.
	It was not an easy decision to go this route, but for the clear distinction and separation of the Flowable project this is the best way forward.
	The discussion for this choice can be found in this forum post <a href="http://forum.flowable.org/t/opinions-on-package-renaming-for-flowable-6-to-org-flowable/118/13">http://forum.flowable.org/t/opinions-on-package-renaming-for-flowable-6-to-org-flowable/118/13</a></li>
	<li>Class name renaming to use Flowable instead of Activiti where needed.</li>
	<li>The identity functionality is separated in the IDM engine, and the identity database tables are managed by this engine. 
	By default the IDM engine is enabled when starting the Flowable engine, but it can be disabled with the disableIdmEngine property.</li>
	<li>Introduction of a content engine, which provides a simple file store for attaching files/documents to a task or process instance.</li>
	<li>Support for non interrupting event sub processes. Until this version only interrupting event sub processes were supported, 
	but now it's possible to handle events and let the main process execution continue as well.</li>
	<li>The task app has been refactored into 3 separate web applications. There's a Flowable Modeler app that contains the modeling repository functionality + the BPMN, form and DMN editor.
	The second app is the Flowable IDM app that manages the users and groups and handles authentication for each app. 
	For example the Flowable Modeler will redirect to the Flowable IDM app when no valid cookie is found. 
	After logging in to the Flowable IDM app, a redirect to the Flowable Modeler is executed and you can access the Modeler repository.
	This is done to allow for single sign-on between the different apps. The third app is the Flowable task app, that allows you to start process instances and work with tasks and fill-in forms.</li>
	<li>Introduction of the Flowable Admin application that allows for querying the BPM, DMN, Form and Content engines.</li>
	<li>Introduction of Docker images to make it easy to start all apps in a convenient way. In the docker folder several docker start scripts can be found that use a Docker compose file.
	In an upcoming blog post we will share more information on how this can be used.</li>
	<li>Persistency logic that was written in Hibernate has all been rewritten to MyBatis to have a common framework for all persistency logic.</li>
	<li>Various and many small bugfixes all around.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Release remarks</h4>

<ul>
	<li>This a major milestone to get to the final Flowable 6.0.0 release. All parts of the release are now considered feature complete, so the remaining work will be bug fixing and smaller features.</li>
	<li>We will continue to improve the docs for the 6.0.0 release.</li>
	<li>At this point all community testing is extremely important for the quality of the 6.0.0 release. So every contribution is this area is very welcome.</li>
</ul>
